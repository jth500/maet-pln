To run this code, please use the three "run_[].ipynb" notebooks in ./notebooks.

Please open these in Google Colab and use the T4 GPU. The notebooks will import all relevant code from our repository and install all relevant packages before running.

If running locally instead, please navigate to this directory (with anaconda installed). Run `conda env create --file=environment.yml`
